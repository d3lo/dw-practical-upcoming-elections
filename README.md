Please see the [Ruby](./ruby/) section of this repository for my submission.

## My process:

I took this in two parts. First, I extended the search route within the application controller to include an API call to Turbovote. This took me about 30-45 minutes to format the URL properly and structure the appropriate call using Net/HTTP.

The following morning, I came back at this and cleaned up the resulting data from Turbovote, as best I could, with a little consulation with the API documentation and testing a significant number of addresses from the list provided.

I also began to write a test for the search results page, but I've never worked with MiniTest before. I abandoned that attempt as I'm already approacing two hours of work, and Stack Overflow happens to be doing maintenance right now.

Thank you for your consideration!
